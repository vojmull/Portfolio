# Selected Projects Portfolio

### 01 Data Generator
Semestral assignment. The aim was to create a program for simple data generation with various distributions.

### 02 PUMA
Selected model from my master's thesis I am currently working on. This is a custom implementation of the U-Net segmentation model with Attention. Designed on the [PUMA dataset](https://puma.grand-challenge.org). 6-instance class medical image segmentation.

### 03 Permits Baseline
Can be found online [here](https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/mullevo3/mvi-sp). This was the baseline and my first touch with the fish permits automatic transcription. This particular repository consists only of the classification of the dates; it's quite simple since it's just a baseline.
